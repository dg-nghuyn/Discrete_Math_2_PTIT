# 📘 Discrete_Math_2_PTIT - Toán rời rạc 2 (CODE_PTIT)

## 🧾 Introduction

This repository contains a complete collection of my programming solutions related to the **Discrete Mathematics 2** course at the **Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology (PTIT)**.

All source codes are developed in **C++** and include implementations of key topics in the course such as graph theory, connectivity, Euler and Hamiltonian paths, shortest paths, spanning trees, and more.

These materials are shared with the aim of assisting students, self-learners, and those preparing for exams at PTIT or similar institutions.
